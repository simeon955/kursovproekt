		<description>Bulgaria&amp;rsquo;s six-month presidency of the European Council has come to a close.
The experience has been transformative for the country, Antoaneta Roussi reports.
&amp;lsquo;In the presidency spotlight, Bulgaria became more visible to the EU.&amp;rsquo;
When Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, many of the country&amp;rsquo;s citizens were filled with hope. After years of uncertainty and economic strife following the end of communism, the nation would finally be what its people always felt it was: European.
But EU membership came with downsides, such as being the poorest country in the bloc and remaining largely on the sidelines of EU decision-making. Bulgaria&amp;rsquo;s modest research and innovation capability also meant that many of its talented researchers left to work in the west.

		<title>SECOND MEETING IN BULGARIA OF THE BOLOGNA FOLLOW-UP GROUP</title>
		<link>https://www.mon.bg/en/news/3083</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2018 16:59:17 +0300</pubDate>

The 60th meeting of the Bologna Follow-Up Group (BFUG) took place in Sofia on 24 and 25 April. It is the second meeting within the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of European Union. The event was opened by Mrs. Denitsa Sacheva, Deputy Minister of Education and Science.
The Forum focused on the main issues to be discussed at the Conference of Ministers responsible for Higher Education in May, 2018 in Paris, as well as on key mechanisms and working arrangements for the next Ministerial Conference in 2020.
The higher education sector is one of the most important pillars for the construction of Europe. Academic freedom and integrity, institutional autonomy and greater student involvement in the lives of universities are all seen as the backbone of the European Higher Education Area.
Mobility, inclusion, innovation are the three major activities for its future. Mobility is a part of young people culture and ensuring mobility means greater trust in the policies offered.
The second BFUG meeting in Sofia also aimed to specify the conditions required for unlocking the full potential of the European Higher Education Area, to ensure all necessary reforms and progress in terms of the set policies. An agreement was reached on all conflicting issues. Both the composition of the initial Bologna Implementation Coordinating Group for peer-learning support and its work regime were adopted. At the explicit insistence of the delegates, Bulgaria was also selected and included in that group. Extremely tense discussions related to the preparation of the Communiqu&amp;eacute; were finalized with the adoption of the text that will be proposed for adoption to the Ministers at their Paris conference in May this year.
The Bologna process is an initiative which started at the end of the 1990s to improve comparability in higher education in Europe and to provide effective academic mobility. The main objective of the Bologna process is to set up a European Higher Education Area, with the following aspects:&amp;nbsp;

Introducing easily comparable educational degrees (Bachelor, Master and Doctor);
Introducing a system of educational credits (ECTS) as a measurement for students&amp;rsquo; performance;
Introducing European standards and guidelines for quality assurance;
Removing the existing obstacles with regard to the free academic mobility in the European Higher Education Area.

The Republic of Bulgaria is amongst the 29 countries which on 19 June 1999 signed in Bologna the Joint Declaration for a European Higher Education Area. Accession to the Bologna process is voluntary, but the implementation of the commitments taken becomes obligatory following the accession.</description>

		<title>14th GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE EUROPEAN QUALITY ASSURANCE REGISTER FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (EQAR) TOOK PLACE IN SOFIA</title>
		<link>https://www.mon.bg/en/news/2999</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 14:11:44 +0300</pubDate>
		<description>The Fourteenth General Assembly of the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR) took place in Sofia within the Bulgarian Presidency of the European Union. The forum was opened by the Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Ms. Denitsa Sacheva. The draft Strategy for the period until 2022 defines the Register as one of the pillars of the European Higher Education Area. EQAR is an example of the opportunities for countries and institutions to work together to achieve common goals and priorities. The two strategic goals for the period, namely ensuring transparency and information, and international trust and recognition, are of paramount importance. EQAR is expected to continue to ensure high quality in the European higher education and to be a source of new ideas. Deputy Minister Sacheva said that the issue of the development of EQAR will also be discussed at the Conference of Ministers responsible for higher education in Paris in May this year.During the General Assembly delegates adopted a number of documents, namely the Strategy for Development of the Register by 2022, the Report for 2017, an Action Plan and a Budget for 2018. The new team of the EQAR Executive Board was also elected. It includes experts with experience and contribution to higher education, and in particular in the field of quality assurance. The EQAR President, Karl Dietrich, described the General Assembly in Sofia as one of the most successful in the history of the Registry. Bulgaria is one of the first countries to sign the Declaration on the creation of a European Higher Education Area in 1999 in Bologna. Every two to three years, in order to track the progress in meeting the Bologna process objectives and to prioritize the actions for the next period, meetings of ministers responsible for higher education are organized. During their regular meeting in May 2007, European Ministers responsible for Higher Education, including the Bulgarian Deputy Minister, gave a mandate to the E4 Group to establish the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR). The E4 Group includes the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA), the European Student Union (ESU), the European University Association (EUA) and the European Association of Institutions in Higher Education (EURASHE). In 2008, they set up EQAR with the main objective of further develop the European Higher Education Area by increasing transparency in quality assurance, a thus enhancing trust in European higher education. All Agencies entered in the Register have the right to conduct evaluation procedures for higher education institutions in other countries. Under the Higher Education Act, in Bulgaria, apart from the National Evaluation and Accreditation Agency (NEAA), such right is also granted to all agencies registered in EQAR. It takes place at the request of the respective higher education institution. At the same time, the only institution authorized to accredit higher education institutions in Bulgaria, is NEAA - an independent body to the Council of Ministers. There are different categories of EQAR members: founding members, social partners and government representatives, usually from the relevant Ministry responsible for higher education. This category includes the Ministry of Education and Science of Bulgaria.</description>

		<description>A new subject &amp;ndash; computer modelling, will be studied in III grade from the start of the next school year. The objective is for children to create in a digital environment using modern visual tools from a very early age.This is what Minister of Education and Science Krasimir Valchev said at the opening of the Flagship Conference &amp;ldquo;Educate to Create: from Digital Consumers to Digital Creators&amp;rdquo; of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the EU.&amp;ldquo;Digital skills will have to be integrated across all subjects,&amp;rdquo; said Minster Valchev, adding that in the digital transformation era education and training have the important role to prepare all young people to work in a new environment and in the future labour market.The conference will result in the adoption of the Sofia Call for Action on Digital Skills and Education.Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev spoke about how important it is for education to develop digital skills but also to invest in critical thinking. &amp;ldquo;We must invest in developing the capacity to make judgement, to think, to compare, to analyse,&amp;rdquo; he said. In his words, the ability to create is what makes the human being a personality.Sofia Mayor Yordanka Fandakova described the forum, which brings attention to teacher training, cooperation with industry and non-formal education, as a major event during the Bulgarian Presidency. She emphasised that quality education was a key factor for the development of all spheres, so investment and teacher training were the most important thing. &amp;ldquo;We must have teachers who are creators. We have to attract young teachers, teachers who not only have digital skills but are also creators,&amp;rdquo; Fandakova said.European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport Mr. Tibor Navracsics spoke about the need to develop digital partnerships. In particular he noted that schools must update their digital curricula so that teachers be prepared.

		<link>https://www.mon.bg/en/news/2956</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 11:04:27 +0300</pubDate>
		<description>European Call for Action will be drawn up during the Bulgarian Presidency of the European Union with recommendations for guaranteeing a long-term sustainable development of scientific and research infrastructures in Europe and opening thereof to European citizens.There is a need for discussing the capacity as regards the scientific and research milieu &amp;ndash; about the resources, infrastructure, human and technological potential, so that the medium becomes competitive and performs cross-cutting priority research. This has been said today by the Minister of Education and Science Krasimir Valchev at the Bulgarian Presidency Flagship Conference &quot;Research Infrastructures beyond 2020 &amp;ndash; sustainable and effective ecosystem for science and society&quot; in Sofia Tech Park.The Minister has underlined that additional funding from the Structural funds is necessary for the scientific infrastructure. The proposal, which the European Commission is expected to make on 2nd May for the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework, including the Ninth Framework Programme for scientific research and innovations, has already become a subject to discussions. Minister Valchev has pointed out that the shared use of scientific facilities for cross-cutting scientific goals is placed in the focus of the European policy by the Bulgarian Presidency.&amp;bdquo;It is&amp;nbsp; important to avail ourselves from the experience of these scientific facilities, which correspond to the largest degree to the needs of health, high technology, environmental preservation, climate changes, protection response in disasters and accidents, and last but not least &amp;ndash; social challenges, in particular, those related to refugees and migration&amp;ldquo;, he has said and added that the necessity from a long-term sustainability of research and scientific infrastructure is beyond a reasonable doubt. &amp;nbsp;In 2017 Bulgaria adapted its National Roadmap for Scientific Infrastructure, by presenting the consolidation potential of the available one in the European families of the respective fields of scientific facilities. At the beginning of March this year the three excellence centres were announced, as well as the seven competence centres. &amp;bdquo;These are totally tens of Bulgarian significant infrastructures, which are expected to change the scientific milieu both in the country, as well as in Europe. Bulgaria makes investments of over EUR 100 million in the two centres&amp;ldquo;, the Minister added. Minister Valchev has appealed for elaborating the concept for an open science in the name of a better milieu in Europe and has again put the emphasis on the attainment of a digital connectivity with the Western Balkans.The European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation Carlos Moedas has observed in a video address to the participants that in Sofia are discussed the new Pan-European initiatives, which correspond to the challenges for guaranteeing a coherent and sustainable scientific and research infrastructural ecosystem over the following years. According to him, in Europe there have already been set up some of the best global facilities, as well as some of the most extensive databases in all scientific fields.&amp;bdquo;We have been setting up European capacity in scientific and research infrastructures for decades, by investing billions of euros from the national budgets and from the EU instruments, such as the European structural and investment funds and the Framework Programs for scientific research and innovations&amp;ldquo;, he noted. One of the goals of the discussions was the improving the publicity and enhancing the partnership between scientific and research infrastructures, the business and the academia. The opportunities for promoting public-private partnerships were discussed at the conference. A key message of the conference was the call for research infrastructures to develop an integrated and reliable high-quality system for the maintenance and exchange of data and related business models, taking full account of ethical issues in this field. It has been noted that a systematic and coherent monitoring of research infrastructures, impact assessments and key performance indicators and the presentation of infrastructures is necessary. It was proposed to develop a common tool for pooling resources from different funds to support the construction and exploitation of the scientific infrastructure. The need for better integration of infrastructures in the scientific, economic and social ecosystem at regional, national and European levels has been taken into account in order to maximise impact.In the next month, conclusions will be drawn from the conference, which will serve as a basis for further discussions and concrete decisions in the Council of the European Union on the future role and financing of research infrastructures in the next EU Research and Innovation Framework Programme.Participants in the discussions were representatives of the European Commission, members of the European Parliament, state secretaries and Ministers responsible for science, scientific research and innovations from the EU member states, as well as heads and coordinators of European projects for scientific and research infrastructures.</description>

		<link>https://www.mon.bg/en/news/2937</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 13:55:23 +0200</pubDate>
		<description>More innovative projects in all sectors of education and training should be funded in the future development of the Erasmus+ programme. This vision was presented at a meeting of the Directors General for Schools, held on 13 and 14 March 2018 in Sofia within the framework of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.A European evaluation of the Erasmus+ programme shows that 93 % of students and 98 % of teachers are satisfied with their participation in the programme. Representatives from the National Erasmus+ Agency stressed the need of opening the programme with a view to inclusion and to increase the involvement of smaller schools and organisations which apply for the first time. More than 140 projects for mobility in Bulgarian schools and kindergartens have been funded under Erasmus+ since the beginning of the present programming period (2014-2020) and more than 440 Bulgarian schools and kindergartens have taken part in partnership projects.During the meeting in Sofia the emphasis was also put on the need to learn foreign languages, improving education and on the mutual recognition of diplomas so that young people can easily find jobs everywhere on the continent.The main conclusion from the discussions on the implementation of the updated framework on key competences for lifelong learning was that focusing on the assessment of key competences would fill an existing deficiency. Participants also underlined that there is a need for major changes in the training of teachers towards a competency-based approach in their work.Ms Sophia Eriksson Waterschoot, Director for Youth, Education and Erasmus+ in the Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC) in the European Commission, underlined that work is still needed in the field of school education. As a result of the proposals made, the Commission is able to reconsider the different intentions in order to meet the expectations of Member States for achieving the common goals.</description>

How can more young people be attracted to participate in student exchange programmes like Erasmus+? What should policy-makers do to create &#039;European universities&#039; and to help students learn languages? How to better integrate technologies into the educational process?&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
These are just a few of the questions which ministers discussed at the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council presided by the Bulgarian Minister for Education and Science, Mr Krasimir Valchev, which took place on 15 February 2018 in Brussels. On behalf of the European Commission, the Commissioners for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport Tibor Navracsics and for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen participated in the meeting.
The ministers discussed two main topics &amp;ndash; the future of the student exchange programme Erasmus+, one of the EU&amp;acute;s success stories, and how to modernise education systems in line with developments in today&amp;acute;s society.
Commenting on the outcome of the meeting, Mr Valchev said:

&quot;Erasmus+ has been one of the most renowned, celebrated and successful EU programmes over the last 30 years, supporting over 9 million Europeans by developing their professional and personal capacities and strengthening European identity and values. Our ministerial debate makes me confident that also after 2020, the programme will continue to provide opportunities for Europeans to study, train and gain experience and knowledge abroad.&quot;

At the press conference following the meeting, Mr Valchev added that any new initiatives in the area of education should be as inclusive as possible. He reminded the audience that helping young people acquire the skills they will need for the future is one of the priorities of the Bulgarian Presidency. This would make it easier for them to find their place on the labour market of tomorrow. At the same time, our society as a whole would be able to address negative trends like false news and cyber threats.
The full intervention of Mr Valchev&#039;s at the press conference, in which Commissioner Navracsics also took part, can be followed here.

		<title>BOLOGNA FOLLOW-UP GROUP PROPOSES SETTING UP PEER-GROUP SUPPORT TO ATTAIN YEREVAN GOALS</title>
		<link>https://www.mon.bg/en/news/2909</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 15:28:42 +0200</pubDate>
		<description>The Bologna Follow-Up Group (BFUG) examined opportunities to set up a peer-group support mechanism to help all participating countries implement key Bologna commitments. The proposal, which aims to attain the goals set at the Yerevan Ministerial Conference in 2015, was discussed during the 58th BFUG meeting, held on 5 and 6 February 2018 at the Boyana Residence in the framework of the Bulgarian Presidency. Participants also discussed a report on the application of the main Bologna principles, noting that considerable progress has been achieved.The current draft report summarises progress indicators for each of the 48 member states of the Bologna process. The indicators measure the progress in attaining the goals set in the Yerevan Communiqu&amp;eacute;, which include enhancing the quality of higher education, promoting the employability of graduates and making training systems more inclusive. In order to tackle specific challenges outlined in the report, the BFUG proposed putting in place procedures through which states facing difficulties can receive assistance on a peer-to-peer basis through thematic support groups. The result of the discussions will be put forward for approval by the Ministers responsible for higher education in the Bologna process member states during their conference in Paris in May this year.The meeting also addressed the progress of Belarus, which is the first state to join the Bologna process following the official start of the European Higher Education Area in 2010. The participating countries decided in Sofia to continue with their efforts to support Belarus in the implementation of the necessary structural reforms in its higher education system.The 58th BFUG meeting was chaired by the Bulgarian and Serbian representatives in the working group as the two countries co-chair the Bologna process in the first half of 2018. Bulgaria will host one more BFUG meeting during its Presidency of the Council of the EU before the Ministerial Conference in May 2018.BackgroundThe Bologna process is an initiative which was set up at the end of the 1990s to improve comparability in higher education in Europe and to provide effective staff mobility. The main goal of the Bologna process is to set up a European Higher Education Area, with the following aspects:

Introducing easily comparable educational degrees (Bachelor, Master and Doctor);
Introducing a system of educational credits (ECTS) as a measurement for students&amp;rsquo; performance;
Introducing European standards in quality assurance;
Removing the existing obstacles with regard to the free mobility of students and teachers in the European Higher Education Area.

The Republic of Bulgaria is among the 29 states which on 19 June 1999 signed in Bologna the Joint Declaration for a European Higher Education Area. Accession to the Bologna process is voluntary, but the implementation of the commitments taken becomes obligatory following the accession.Related linksVisit the meeting page on the website of the European Higher Education Area: http://www.ehea.info/cid122121/bfug-meeting-58.htmlRead the Yerevan Communiqu&amp;eacute;: http://bologna-yerevan2015.ehea.info/pages/view/documents For more information:Ivana Radonova, PhD.State expertHigher Education DirectorateMinistry of Education and Science2A Kniaz Alexander Dondukov Blvd., Sofia 1000, Bulgariatel.: +359 2 9217 541e-mail: i.radonova@mon.bg</description>

		<title>EU RESEARCH MINISTERS DISCUSS FUTURE OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN EUROPE</title>

Investment in human capital and the possibilities for stimulating innovation were in the focus of the informal meeting of EU Research ministers in Sofia on 2 February 2018. In a discussion about the future of research and innovation in Europe, Ministers exchanged views on instruments, strategies and best practices in order to start the process of finding a common European vision during the coming months.
&amp;ldquo;Knowledge transfer is a key challenge for the EU, which is a world leader in the field of research and innovation. We need to look for a way to put this knowledge more easily to the benefit of society and industry. The digitalisation and transformation of entire economic sectors, the demand for new skills, and the pressure on education to generate quality and innovative lifelong learning pose questions to policies for funding research and innovation&amp;rdquo;, said the Bulgarian Minister of Education and Science Krasimir Valchev. &amp;ldquo;In the process of preparing the Ninth Framework Programme there should be an additional requirement for increasing knowledge transfer and improving the access to scientific results for citizens, companies and even public organisations. People are the most important resource we have at our disposal, and efforts must start at the point of education&amp;rdquo;, Mr Valchev added.
Ministers discussed the mid-term evaluation of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, underlining that it is a landmark example of targeting scientific funding to important day tasks such as health, security, sustainable agriculture and bio-economy, clean and efficient energy, ecology and climate, and more. However, the assessment shows that the so-called &quot;innovation gap&quot; continues to be present and new measures are needed to increase the benefits of research funding and dissemination of results in all regions of the European Union. The Bulgarian Presidency stressed that cohesion policy and the next generation of structural funds, as well as their synergies with the Framework Programme and Erasmus+ in terms of capacity building and the opening of the potential of Europe&#039;s peripheral regions, should be priorities in the next multiannual financial period.
During the discussions, the Independent High-Level Group of Innovators presented their 14 recommendations on what the new European Innovation Council should do under the motto &amp;ldquo;Europe is back: Accelerating breakthrough innovation&amp;rdquo;. Ministers welcomed the recommendations and called for equal conditions for participation of all innovators.
Background
Horizon 2020 is the financial instrument implementing the Innovation Union, an initiative aimed at securing Europe&#039;s global competitiveness. It provides nearly &amp;euro;80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020).

		<description>The Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the Ministry of Education and Science place young people at the centre of the debate on the future of Europe, as they contribute to the generation of new and innovative ideas. The future competitiveness of our economies will depend on their capabilities and skills. They will indeed live in the renewed European Union.
The overarching aim of the debate will be to safeguard the level of European investments in education and scientific research, including with a view to providing access to education and skills development at any age, and promoting digital, entrepreneurial and creative skills, and providing adequate infrastructure for education, training, and scientific research.
A key priority of the Bulgarian Presidency will be the continuation of the work on the European Commission package on &#039;Modernising Education &amp;ndash; Youth Initiative&#039; and the progress on the New Skills Agenda for Europe. An emphasis will be given to the mid-term review of the Erasmus+ Programme and facilitating political discussions on its future in the context of the forthcoming European Commission&#039;s proposal for the new Multiannual Financial Framework.
The Bulgarian Presidency will work towards achieving general agreement within the Education Committee of the Council on the proposal for a Council Recommendation regarding the promotion of social inclusion and shared values through formal and non-formal education and training, and the proposal for a Recommendation to amend the Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong learning.
In the context of the initiative for the creation of a European Education Area by 2025, outlined in the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s Communication &#039;Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture&#039;, the Bulgarian Presidency will work with all stakeholders to formulate an Action Plan for digital education, developing digital skills and digital literacy. A conference on the topic will be held in the City of Sofia in April 2018.
In the Research and Innovation sector, the Bulgarian Presidency will propose for adoption Council Conclusions on the optimization of knowledge transfer and acceleration of research results, including broader access to research results by industry and society throughout the European Union. Bulgaria will work for the adoption of Council Conclusions on further implementation of the multilateral collaborative project, International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). Furthermore, conclusions will be drawn and suggestions will be made on the roadmap for governance and funding of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative. The efforts will be focused on extending the term of the Regulation on Euratom Programme for research and training of the European Atomic Energy Community (2019-2020) in addition to the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation &amp;ldquo;Horizon 2020&amp;rdquo; until 31 December 2020. It will start work on the Proposal for a Regulation on the framework for cooperation in High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC).</description>

		<title>MINISTER VALCHEV: THE UNIVERSITY RANKING SYSTEM SERVES AS A BASIS FOR OPTIMIZING THE ADMITTANCE AND FUNDING PROCESSES OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS</title>
		<link>https://www.mon.bg/en/news/2904</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 14:33:35 +0200</pubDate>
		<description>&amp;ldquo;As a result of the Ranking system of higher education institutions in Bulgaria, the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) is able to make a comprehensive assessment of the quality of educational work in line with the needs of the labour market. It serves as a basis for the policy for restructuring the admittance and funding processes of universities and facilitates the links between the higher education market and labour market.&amp;rdquo; These words were said by the Minister of Education and Science Krasimir Valchev, at the presentation of the new edition of the University Ranking System (http://rsvu.mon.bg). According to him, the policies give a result and should continue, relying on the processed data, derived from the System. Its new edition demonstrates a continuing trend in improving the achievement of higher education graduates in the labour market, whilst at the same time confirming the existence of large differences in average income, unemployment and applicability of the acquired higher education degree depending on the completed professional field and the specific higher education establishment. According to the ranking system data gathered for 2017, the proportion of registered unemployed persons among the graduates from the Bulgarian universities in the last 5 years dropped to 2.91% in 2017 as compared to 3.38% in preceding year and to more than 4% in year 2013.
For a next consecutive year, the lowest unemployment (less than 1%) and the highest degree of applicability of the higher education degree acquired (over 90%) have been observed among the graduates in professional fields Medicine, Pharmacy, Stomatology and Military Science. An unemployment rate of more than 4% is registered only in three professional fields - Religion and Theology, Social Work and Materials and Materials Sciences.
The ten professional fields with the highest average income among graduates are: Informatics and Computer Science; Mathematics; Communication and Computer Technology; Public Health; Research, Extraction and Development of Ores and Minerals; Metallurgy; Military work; Pharmacy; Medicine; and Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Automation. The graduates in Informatics and Computer Science from the Sofia University and those in Administration and Management from the American University are distinguished by an average monthly taxable income of over BGN 3 000.
The highest average grades of the diploma for completed secondary education have the enrolled students in the first course of the professional fields Medicine (5.57), Pharmacy (5.51) and Stomatology (5.46). With the lowest grades of the completed secondary education are the freshmen in the professional fields Animal Breeding and Reproduction (4.29), Materials and Materials Science (4.40) and Research, Extraction and Development of Ores and Minerals (4.40).</description>

		<title>THE FIRST OF THE EVENTS IN SECTOR &quot;EDUCATION&quot; ON THE CALENDAR OF THE BULGARIAN PRESIDENCY OF THE EU COUNCIL TOOK PLACE IN SOFIA</title>
		<link>https://www.mon.bg/en/news/2907</link>

On November 30 2017, the Ministry of Education and Science hosted the High Level Group in Education and Training. This was the first of the events in sector &amp;lsquo;Education&amp;rsquo; on the calendar of the Bulgarian Presidency of the EU Council even before the first half of 2018.&amp;nbsp;
Topics related to the future European cooperation in the area of education and training were discussed in the meeting.&amp;nbsp; More specifically, these were the scope and the mandates of the Thematic Working Groups on Digital Skills and Competences and on Promoting &amp;nbsp;Citizenship and the Common Values of Freedom, Tolerance and Non-Discrimination through Education in the period&amp;nbsp; 2018-2020, as well as the other four thematic Working Groups which are operating within the European Commission (EC) with all member states participating.&amp;nbsp; They are TG on Schools, on Vocational Education and Training, on Adult Learning and on Modernisation of Higher Education.&amp;nbsp; During this first discussion, the member states reached an agreement in principle on the mandates of these working groups, proposed by the EC.
&amp;ldquo;The most important feature of European Cooperation is the value added,&amp;rdquo; Stefaan Hermans, Director for Policy Strategy and Evaluation at DG Education of EC, said during the meeting. &amp;nbsp;According to him, the meeting in Sofia coincided with the easing of the visa regime with Canada and this was yet another reason to rethink the policies and innovations in the area of education and their focus in the world. In the session on reviewing the implementation of the Strategic Framework for European Cooperation &amp;lsquo;Education and Training 2020&amp;rsquo;, the member states shared their experience and impressions from the value added of the cooperation between them. During the sessions of the various networks and working groups, aimed at sharing experience, good practices and using various common instruments at European level and mutual training were outlined as a catalyst of educational reforms. All these activities are standing out as main disseminators of the European culture.
Bulgarian Deputy Minister of Education and Science Denitsa Sacheva urged the delegates to continue the implementation of good examples in the area of civil education. She underlined that, at the moment, the topic of education has been brought to the top of the agenda of Europe and that it is an opportunity for optimizing national policies.
With its first event, the Bulgarian Presidency of the EU Council provided a platform for another exchange of opinion in the process of consultations with the member states regarding the development of European cooperation in education and training beyond 2020.
Some of the more important results that stood out after the discussions were the role of digital technology for the economy, the European citizens and the community as a whole. &amp;nbsp;All EU citizens should acquire digital competences, which they need in their everyday life, at their workplace and in view of acquiring a higher level of education. Research shows that at the moment one in four EU citizens does not have any basic digital competences, and one in five does not have any digital competences at all.&amp;nbsp; This is why education and training have to overcome this shortage and provide the advantages of the digital era to all.
A meeting in this format is traditionally held prior to the official start of each rotational EU Council Presidency. Issues of strategic nature, related to the development of the cooperation at the EU level in the area of education and training, are discussed. The results of the discussions are then taken into account in the process of the activity of the Presidency of the EU Council and the European Commission and are reflected in a number of strategic and political papers of the EU institutions.
High level officials from the Ministries of Education of the member states, the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the EU Council take part in this format. The meeting is chaired by the country, taking over the rotational Presidency of the EU Council in the following semester, in this case &amp;ndash; the Bulgarian Presidency. The final mandates of all Working Groups will be approved at the next high level meeting to be organized in June 2018 by Austria as the next country taking over the rotational Presidency of the EU Council after Bulgaria.
